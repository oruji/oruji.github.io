Is Data Passed by Reference or by Value in Java?
</button><pre class="content">
Java is a strictly pass-by-value language.
When we pass primitives to a method, its value is copied into a new variable. 
When it comes to objects, the value of the reference is copied into a new variable

What is a Marker Interface?
</button><pre class="content">
An empty interface in Java is referred to as a Marker interface. 
Serializable and Cloneable are some famous examples of Marker Interface.

Define Wrapper Classes in Java.
</button><pre class="content">
In Java, when you declare primitive datatypes, then Wrapper classes are responsible for converting them into objects(Reference types).

Can you implement pointers in a Java Program?
</button><pre class="content">
Java Virtual Machine takes care of memory management implicitly. Java's primary motto was to keep programming simple. 
So, accessing memory directly through pointers is not a recommended action. Hence, pointers are eliminated in Java.

What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
</button><pre class="content">
JVM has a Just in Time (JIT) compiler tool that converts all the Java source code into the low-level compatible machine language. 
Therefore, it runs faster than the regular application.

JRE has class libraries and other JVM supporting files. But it doesn’t have any tool for java development such as compiler or debugger.

JDK has tools that are required to write Java Programs and uses JRE to execute them. 
It has a compiler, Java application launcher, and an applet viewer.

What is a JIT compiler?
</button><pre class="content">
When we compile our Java program (e.g., using the javac command), 
we'll end up with our source code compiled into the binary representation of our code – a JVM bytecode. 
This bytecode is simpler and more compact than our source code, but conventional processors in our computers cannot execute it.

To be able to run a Java program, the JVM interprets the bytecode. 
Since interpreters are usually a lot slower than native code executing on a real processor, 
the JVM can run another compiler which will now compile our bytecode into the machine code that can be run by the processor. 
This so-called just-in-time compiler is much more sophisticated than the javac compiler, and it runs complex optimizations to generate high quality machine code.
