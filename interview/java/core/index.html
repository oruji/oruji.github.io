Can you implement pointers in a Java Program?
</button><pre class="content">
Java Virtual Machine takes care of memory management implicitly. Java's primary motto was to keep programming simple. 
So, accessing memory directly through pointers is not a recommended action. Hence, pointers are eliminated in Java.

What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
</button><pre class="content">
JVM has a Just in Time (JIT) compiler tool that converts all the Java source code into the low-level compatible machine language. 
Therefore, it runs faster than the regular application.

JRE has class libraries and other JVM supporting files. But it doesnâ€™t have any tool for java development such as compiler or debugger.

JDK has tools that are required to write Java Programs and uses JRE to execute them. 
It has a compiler, Java application launcher, and an applet viewer.

What is a JIT compiler?
</button><pre class="content">
JIT compiler refers to Just in Time compiler. It is the simplest way of executing the computer code that takes in compilation during 
the execution of a program rather than before performance. It commonly uses bytecode translation to machine code. It is then executed directly.
